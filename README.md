# Who's Mariia and What’s She Building? 👋🐾

Hi, I’m **Mariia Krestenko** – an aspiring data analyst who actually enjoys  
cleaning messy data (yes, really 😄) and turning it into something useful.

I’m currently exploring:

- 🧹 **Data cleaning & preparation** – from raw CSV chaos to modelling-ready datasets   
- 🤖 **Machine learning** – starting with classic problems like **customer churn**

---

## 🚀 Right now I’m working on

- **Bank Customer Churn Analysis**  
  Cleaning and exploring data for 10,000 European bank customers,  
  then building a model to predict who is likely to leave.

---

## 🛠 Toolbox

- **Languages:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn), SQL  
- **BI & Data:** Tableau, Excel, Jupyter Notebooks  
- **Version control:** Git & GitHub  
- **Other:** A healthy relationship with Google and Stack Overflow 😉

---

## 🎯 Goals for 2025

- Build a small but mighty portfolio of **end-to-end projects**  
  (data cleaning → EDA → model / dashboard → business insights).  
- Get very comfortable with **GitHub workflows** and collaborative data projects.  
- Land a role where I can say “Yes, I did this analysis” and actually mean it.

## 🌱 Learning in public

I like to keep my work transparent, even when it’s messy:

- Improving code readability and documentation  
- Experimenting with different modelling approaches  
- Writing short project summaries so non-data people can follow along

If you’re into data, dashboards, or just enjoy watching someone level up in public,  
feel free to ⭐ repos, open issues, or just say hi.  

**Thanks for stopping by!** ✨
