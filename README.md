# Who's Mariia and What's She Building? 👋 📊

Hi 👋 I’m a Data & ML enthusiast who is passionate about bringing data,
technology and people together to solve problems and support better decisions.
I enjoy working on data cleaning, exploratory analysis and beginner-friendly
machine learning projects, especially around topics like customer behaviour and
business performance.

I have experience with analytics projects that involve gathering requirements,
preparing and transforming data, building reports and communicating insights to
non-technical stakeholders.
