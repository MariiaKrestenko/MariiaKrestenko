# Hi, I’m Mariia – Curious About Data, Machine Learning & How Things Really Work 🤖📊

Hi 👋 I’m a Data & ML enthusiast who is passionate about bringing data,
technology and people together to solve problems and support better decisions.

I’m drawn to data science because real-world data reflects how things actually are.
Once you start analysing it, it's not just “doing numbers” but uncovering patterns that can change decisions, workflows and the world around us.
