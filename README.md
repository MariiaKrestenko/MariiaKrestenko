# Who's Mariia and What's She Building?  🤖📊

Hi 👋 I’m a Data & ML enthusiast who is passionate about bringing data,
technology and people together to solve problems and support better decisions.

I’m drawn to data science because real-world data reflects how things actually are.
Once you start analysing it, you’re not just “doing numbers” - it’s uncovering patterns that can change decisions, workflows and in small ways, the world around us.
